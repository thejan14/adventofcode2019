# Advent of Code 2019

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) 2019 contribution! The solutions are written in Rust. Though I'm a professional software developer (C#, Typescrip) I am new to rust and use the project for learning the language. Happy reading!

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of code is made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

> [It is] an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

For more information see [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).
